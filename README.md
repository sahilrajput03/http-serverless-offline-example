FYI: There is a websocket version of serverless-offline as well: https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/tree/master/examples/events/websocket

FYI: We can use nodemon while developing the applications as they have this [`nodemon` example](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/blob/master/examples/tools/nodemon/package.json#L5) for `serverless-offline` in examples directory.

FYI: With `serverless-offline` we can emulate api gateway locally as well, yo!!

FYI: `serverless-dotenv` ?

`serverless-dotnev` helps us to setp env values.
